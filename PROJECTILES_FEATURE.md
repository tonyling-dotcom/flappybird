# ðŸ’¥ Enemy Projectiles Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### New Combat Mechanic: Enemy Projectiles
Enemies now shoot slow-moving energy balls at the player, adding a dodging challenge to the game!

## Features

### 1. **Homing Projectiles**
- Projectiles aim at the player's position when fired
- Calculate trajectory using vector math
- Move in straight line toward target location
- Speed: 3-5 pixels/frame (slow enough to dodge)

### 2. **Pulsing Animation**
- Dynamic size changes create pulsing effect
- Uses sine wave for smooth animation
- Animation frame tracks lifetime
- Creates sense of energy and danger

### 3. **Visual Design**
- **Outer glow**: Dark purple-red (80, 20, 60)
- **Middle layer**: Bright red (180, 40, 40)
- **Inner core**: Red-orange (255, 100, 80)
- **Center spot**: Bright yellow-white (255, 200, 150)
- Size: 15x15 pixels (configurable)
- Multi-layered circular design

### 4. **Enemy Shooting Logic**
- **Shoot Interval**: Every 1.5-2.5 seconds (varies by level)
- **Smart Targeting**: Only shoots when player is in front (to the left)
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents rapid-fire spam
- **Position Tracking**: Shoots from enemy center
- **Sound Effect**: Plays enemy sound when firing

### 5. **Collision Detection**
- Projectiles end the game on contact with player
- Accurate hitbox matching
- Removed when off-screen for performance
- Instant game over on hit

## Configuration

All projectile settings are in `levels.json`:

```json
{
  "enemy_shoot_interval": 2500,  // Time between shots (ms)
  "projectile_speed": 3,          // Movement speed (pixels/frame)
  "projectile_size": 15           // Projectile diameter (pixels)
}
```

### Difficulty Progression

| Level | Shoot Interval | Projectile Speed | Difficulty |
|-------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| 1 - Easy Glide | 2.5s | 3 px/frame | Easy to dodge |
| 2 - City Cruiser | 2.3s | 3.5 px/frame | Moderate |
| 3 - Urban Flyer | 2.0s | 4 px/frame | Challenging |
| 4 - Skyline Master | 1.8s | 4.5 px/frame | Difficult |
| 5 - Legendary Bird | 1.5s | 5 px/frame | Expert only |

## Code Structure

### New Class: `Projectile`
- **Location**: `flappy_bird.py` (lines 237-290)
- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(start_x, start_y, target_x, target_y, speed)` - Calculate trajectory
  - `update()` - Move projectile along trajectory
  - `draw(surface)` - Render pulsing energy ball
  - `collides_with(player)` - Check collision with player
  - `is_off_screen()` - Check if should be removed

### Enemy Class Updates
- Added `last_shot_time` - Tracks shooting cooldown
- Added `shoot_interval` - Time between shots
- Added `projectile_speed` - Speed for projectiles
- New method: `can_shoot(current_time, player)` - Check if ready to fire
- New method: `shoot(player)` - Create and return projectile

### Game Class Updates
- Added `self.projectiles` list to track all projectiles
- Updated `update()` to:
  - Check if enemies should shoot
  - Create new projectiles
  - Update all projectile positions
  - Check projectile-player collisions
  - Remove off-screen projectiles
- Updated `draw_game()` to render projectiles
- Reset projectiles in `start_game()`

## Physics & Math

### Trajectory Calculation
```python
# Calculate direction vector
dx = target_x - start_x
dy = target_y - start_y
distance = sqrt(dxÂ² + dyÂ²)

# Normalize and scale by speed
velocity_x = (dx / distance) Ã— speed
velocity_y = (dy / distance) Ã— speed
```

### Animation
```python
# Pulsing effect
pulse = |sin(frame Ã— 0.2)| Ã— 3
radius = base_radius + pulse
```

## Balance & Gameplay

### Why Projectiles Work Well

1. **Telegraphed**: Visual warning before shooting
2. **Slow Speed**: Player has time to react and dodge
3. **Predictable**: Straight-line trajectory
4. **Fair Frequency**: Not overwhelming spam
5. **Risk/Reward**: Can still catch enemies for +3 points

### Strategic Elements

- **Positioning**: Stay aware of enemy locations
- **Timing**: Flap to dodge incoming projectiles
- **Risk Assessment**: Is catching an enemy worth the projectile danger?
- **Vertical Movement**: Use Y-axis to avoid projectiles
- **Spatial Awareness**: Track multiple projectiles

## Performance

- Projectiles automatically removed when off-screen
- Efficient collision detection
- Minimal memory footprint (~100 bytes per projectile)
- Typical count: 2-5 projectiles on screen at once

## Testing

âœ… Game loads without errors
âœ… Enemies shoot at configured intervals
âœ… Projectiles aim at player correctly
âœ… Trajectory calculation is accurate
âœ… Pulsing animation works smoothly
âœ… Collision detection functions properly
âœ… Game over triggers on hit
âœ… Projectiles removed when off-screen
âœ… Performance remains smooth
âœ… Sound effects play correctly

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Power-up: Temporary shield to block projectiles
- Projectile types: Fast, slow, homing, splitting
- Destroy projectiles by catching coins
- Slow-motion power-up for better dodging
- Score bonus for near-miss dodges
- Visual trail effect for projectiles
- Different projectile colors per level

## Game Feel

The projectiles add a new dimension to gameplay:
- **Action**: More active dodging required
- **Challenge**: Increases difficulty naturally
- **Engagement**: Keep players alert and focused
- **Fairness**: Slow enough to be skill-based, not luck
- **Variety**: Each playthrough feels different

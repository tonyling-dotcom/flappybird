# ðŸª™ Coins Feature - Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### New Game Element: Floating Coins
Animated gold coins that rotate and float across the screen for the player to collect!

## Features

### 1. **3D Rotation Animation**
- Coins rotate continuously creating a 3D spinning effect
- Uses trigonometric calculations to simulate depth
- Smooth 360-degree rotation at 3 degrees per frame

### 2. **Floating Motion**
- Coins bob up and down with a sine wave pattern
- Amplitude: 15 pixels
- Frequency: 0.08 (slower than enemies for variety)
- Each coin has a random starting offset for varied motion

### 3. **Visual Design**
- **Outer ring**: Bright gold (255, 215, 0)
- **Inner core**: Darker gold (218, 165, 32)
- **Highlight**: Light yellow shine (255, 255, 200)
- Size: 30x30 pixels (configurable)

### 4. **Gameplay Integration**
- **Spawn Rate**: Every 2.5-4 seconds (varies by level)
- **Movement Speed**: 2-4 pixels/frame (increases with level)
- **Score Value**: +2 points per coin collected
- **Collection Sound**: Reuses flap sound effect

### 5. **HUD Display**
- Coins collected counter in gold color
- Located below level indicator
- Format: "Coins: X"

## Configuration

All coin settings are in `levels.json`:

```json
{
  "coin_speed": 2.0,           // Movement speed (pixels/frame)
  "coin_spawn_interval": 4000, // Time between spawns (ms)
  "coin_size": 30,             // Coin diameter (pixels)
  "score_per_coin": 2          // Points awarded
}
```

## Code Structure

### New Class: `Coin`
- **Location**: `flappy_bird.py` (lines 215-269)
- **Methods**:
  - `__init__(level_config)` - Initialize with position and physics
  - `update(frame_count)` - Update position and rotation
  - `draw(surface)` - Render 3D coin with rotation effect
  - `collides_with(player)` - Collision detection
  - `is_off_screen()` - Check if coin should be removed

### Game Class Updates
- Added `self.coins` list
- Added `self.coins_collected` counter
- Added `self.last_coin_spawn` timer
- New method: `spawn_coin()`
- Updated `update()` to handle coin spawning and collection
- Updated `draw_game()` to render coins and counter

## Balance

Coins spawn at a medium frequency between walls and enemies:
- **Walls**: Every 2-3 seconds (navigation challenge)
- **Coins**: Every 2.5-4 seconds (bonus collection)
- **Enemies**: Every 5-8 seconds (rare bonus target)

Point values:
- **Wall Pass**: +1 point (common, consistent)
- **Coin Collect**: +2 points (medium risk/reward)
- **Enemy Catch**: +3 points (higher risk, better reward)

## Testing

âœ… Game loads without errors
âœ… Coins spawn at configured intervals
âœ… Rotation animation works smoothly
âœ… Floating motion adds visual interest
âœ… Collision detection functions correctly
âœ… Score and counter update properly
âœ… Coins properly removed when off-screen

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- Add different coin types (silver, bronze) with different values
- Coin trails or sparkle effects
- Magnetic power-up that attracts nearby coins
- Coin chains (bonus for collecting multiple in a row)
- Sound effect specifically for coins (cha-ching!)

Enjoy collecting those coins! ðŸª™âœ¨
